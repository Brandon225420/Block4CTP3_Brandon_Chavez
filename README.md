Programming Experience: Beginner/mediocre


9th Grade Year: In the space below, write 2-5 sentences describing your programming experience in the previous year, even if you went to another school.


I'd say for highschool, we learned how all of the basics of coding, we also learned how
code a 360 degree space(vr) and were able to expand what we learned and add to the work
we already made. For middle school I learned a lower level of coding, like using blocks
of steps and arrange them to make a app and make it work.




10th Grade Year: In 2-5 sentences, describe each of the programming projects you’ve completed this year.  Think back to Block 1, Block 2/3, and your Passion Project (if that applies).


I was never actually put in a CT class until Block 3, but I was able to learn new things
like the basic level of coding like binary, hexa decimal, etc. These types of coding
were mainly used by actually coders that made games, and websites. This was very fascinating
so I learned what I could and practiced. I also learned the ways coders actaully code and 
what kind of systems they use in my passion project.


What is one part or element of programming that you would like to improve or grow in this year?


Definetly actually learning how to code certaing things like games, computers, websites, etc.


What is one part of programming or this class that you feel like challenges you more than others?


That you really have to focuse and really know what your doing to get something done and not making mistakes in the long run.


What is your “goal” with computer programming or Computational Thinking?  This answer can be focused on your time at school, or it could describe how you want to experience college or your future career.


I guess it would be that computer programming can maybe be a thing i want to do or a
Option I guess, I would also like to know what i am able to accomplish at my level.
